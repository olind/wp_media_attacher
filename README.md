# wp_media_attacher
Searches WordPress media library for unattached media and tries to locate the file to it's post.

Not nearly production quality. Used to clean my own really old (20+ years) websites.

Place the folder in wp-content. Use WP-CLI to run it with: wp eval-file wp_media_attacher.php --debug
